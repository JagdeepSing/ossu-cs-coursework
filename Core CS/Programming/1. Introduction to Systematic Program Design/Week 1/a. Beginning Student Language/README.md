# Module Overview
## Beginning Student Language (BSL)

This course uses a specially designed programming language called Beginning Student Language (BSL). The BSL language is small and simple, and can learn most of it in this first module. 

There's 2 benefits to this simplicity. 
  1. Allows us to spend more time learning the design method which is the real focus of the course.
  2. BSL forms the core of nearly every other language you will ever use, learning the design method using BSL will help you adapt the material you learn in this course to other programming languages.

## Learning Goals
  
  - Be able to write expressions that operate on primitive data including numbers, strings, images and booleans.
  - Be able to write constant and function definitions.
  - Be able to write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expressions including function calls.
  - Be able to use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluation of an expression.
  - Be able to use the Dr Racket help desk to discover new primitives.
