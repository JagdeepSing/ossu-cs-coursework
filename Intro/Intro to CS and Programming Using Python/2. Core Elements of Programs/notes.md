#### Variables

- **name**
  - descriptive
  - meaningful
  - helps you re-read code
  - cannot be keywords (int, float, etc)
- **value**
  - information stored
  - can be updated

### Variable Binding with `=`

- compute the right hand side -> VALUE

- store it (aka bind it) in the left hand side -> VARIABLE

- left hand side will be replaced with new value

- `=` is called assignment

  `x = 2`		

  `x = x * x`

  `y = x + 1`
